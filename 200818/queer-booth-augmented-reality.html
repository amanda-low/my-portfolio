          <p class="desc_title">Original Version</p>
          <p class="desc">
            The original Queer Booth app was
            <span class="bold">launched in 2015</span> by Jo Webber. At the
            time, photo booth style apps - where you could upload a selfie and
            try on outfits - were popular and she saw noticed a
            <span class="bold">gap in the market</span> for a version that
            catered to the LGBTQ+ community.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Aware of the extent of homophobic bullying after working with a
            youth charity, Jo wanted to
            <span class="bold">normalise queerness</span> and make
            education fun.</span>
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The Queer Booth app was launched successfully in the Apple App
            Store, however in 2016 Jo paused further development of the app
            due to lack of resources.

          <br />
          <div class="desc">
            The app needed to be updated to fit current technology - standalone
            photo booth apps now take a backseat to the augmented reality
            <span class="bold">selfie filters</span> widely found on social
            media apps. <br /><br />
            It also needed to be updated to match the
            <span class="bold">increased visibility</span> of the LGBTQ+
            community. While the original app showcased outfits on what could
            now be viewed as stereotypes of gay and lesbian identities, Jo wanted the new version to be inclusive for all on the
            <span class="bold">LGBTQ+ spectrum.</span>

            <span class="bold">Redesign the Queer Booth app for relaunch.</span>
            <br /><br />
            Jo was quite open to changing the overall design, including the
            app features and user flow. For the relaunch she said she was
            inspired by Bitmojis, Facebook Stickers, queer dating apps, and
            SnapChat selfie filters.
            <br /><br />
            It was important to her that the user experience was <span class="bold">quick and
            seamless</span>, and the pink from the original logo should remain.
            The target audience should remain
            <span class="bold">Generation Z</span>. <br /><br />

            The aim of our survey was to collect <span class="bold">quantitative data</span> from the
            LGBTQ+ community regarding:
            <ul>
              <li>Self expression of sexual orientation and gender identity</li>
              <li>
                Self expression of sexual orientation and gender identity online

              <li>Other apps providing LGBTQ+ features</li>
            </ul>
            Participants had the option to give a qualitative answer if they did
            not feel confident expressing their sexual orientation and gender
            identity online.
            <br /><br />
            In over 3 days we received over 140 responses to our online survey.

            The main trends revealed were:
            <ul>
              <li>
                65% of Generation Z participants thought that selfies are a <span class="bold">good
                form</span> of LGBTQ+ self expression.
              </li>
              <li>68% of participants <span class="bold">share selfies</span> on Messaging Apps</li>
              <li>
                50% express their sexual orientation by <span class="bold">sharing content</span> online
              </li>
            </ul>
            The answers from those not confident to express themselves online, ranged from the <span class="bold">conservative views</span> of family/friends to feeling that self expression was better done in <span class="bold">real life</span>.

          <div class="desc">
            We conducted 8 face-to-face user interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals to gather further
            <span class="bold">qualitative information</span> regarding LGBTQ+ self expression online.
            <br><br>
            Collating and interpreting the the qualitive data was perhaps the
            most challenging part of this project. The interviewiees' attitudes
        varied, depending on each
            individual's background and their stage of "coming out" or self expression.
            Nonethless we wanted our solution to be inclusive of all the opinions heard.
           <br><br>
           After an intense card sorting session, Hanna and I narrowed down two major areas of concern: 
            <ol>
              <li>Self Expression</li>
              <li>Representation</li>

          <div class="desc">
       Social media apps play a large role in <span class="bold">representation</span> for the LGBTQ+ community, and 
         the people that needed the most <span class="bold">visiblity online</span> were the
            ones just starting their journey, as expressed by this interviewee: 
            <br />
         <blockquote>
            "Many people are not comfortable expressing (their sexuality). But
            it’s still important to feel represented by someone you can relate
            to."
        </blockquote>
            After voting on "How Might We" statements related to the two main areas of concern, the statement with the highest votes was:
        <blockquote class="main_subtitle">
            How might we allow users to share their stories?
