          <p class="desc">
            The original Queer Booth app was
            <span class="bold">launched in 2015</span> by Jo Webber. At the
            time, photo booth style apps - where you could upload a selfie and
            try on outfits - were popular and she saw noticed a
            <span class="bold">gap in the market</span> for a version that
            catered to the LGBTQ+ community.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Aware of the extent of homophobic bullying after working with a
            youth charity, Jo wanted to
            <span class="bold">normalise queerness</span> and make education
            fun.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            The Queer Booth app was launched successfully in the Apple App
            Store, however in 2016 Jo paused further development of the app due
            to lack of resources.

          <div class="desc">
            The app needed to be updated to fit current technology - standalone
            photo booth apps now take a backseat to the augmented reality (AR)
            <span class="bold">selfie filters</span> widely found on social
            media apps. <br /><br />
            It also needed to be updated to match the
            <span class="bold">increased visibility</span> of the LGBTQ+
            community. While the original app showcased outfits on what could
            now be viewed as stereotypes of gay and lesbian identities, Jo
            wanted the new version to be inclusive for all on the
            <span class="bold">LGBTQ+ spectrum.</span>

            Jo was quite open to changing the overall design, including the app
            features and user flow. For the relaunch she said she was
            <span class="bold">inspired by</span> Bitmojis, Facebook Stickers,
            queer dating apps, and SnapChat selfie filters. <br /><br />
            It was important to her that the user experience was
            <span class="bold">quick and seamless</span>, and the pink from the
            original logo should remain. The target audience should remain

            The aim of our survey was to collect

            Participants had the option to give a qualitative answer if they did
            not feel confident expressing their sexual orientation and gender
            identity online.
            <br /><br />
            In over 3 days we received over 140 responses to our online survey.

                <span class="bold">65%</span> of Generation Z participants
                thought that selfies are a

            The answers from those not confident to express themselves online,
            ranged from the <span class="bold">conservative views</span> of

            We conducted 8 face-to-face user interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals
            to gather further
            <span class="bold">qualitative information</span> regarding LGBTQ+
            self expression online. <br /><br />
            Collating and interpreting the the qualitive data was perhaps the
            most challenging part of this project. The interviewiees'
            <span class="bold">attitudes varied</span>, depending on each
            individual's background and their
            <span class="bold">stage of "coming out"</span> or self expression.
            Nonethless we wanted our solution to be inclusive of all the
            opinions heard. <br /><br />
            After an intense card sorting session, Hanna and I narrowed down two
            major areas of concern:
            <ol>
              <li>Self Expression</li>
              <li>Representation</li>

            Social media apps play a large role in
            <span class="bold">representation</span> for the LGBTQ+ community,
            and the people that needed the most
            <span class="bold">visiblity online</span> were the ones just
            starting their journey, as expressed by this interviewee:
            <br />
            <blockquote>
              "Many people are not comfortable expressing (their sexuality). But
              it’s still
              <span class="bold">important to feel represented</span> by someone
              you can relate to."
            </blockquote>
            After voting on "How Might We" statements related to the two main
            areas of concern, the statement with the highest votes was:
            <blockquote class="main_subtitle">

            Our aim was to create the new Queer Booth app as a place to share
            stories without judgement, with LGBTQ+ themed selfie filters. So
            users can express their
            <span class="bold">inner and outer</span> selves.

          <div class="desc">
            From our interviews, top requests for filters included:
            <span class="bold">Pride and celebrity themed</span> filters. Asked
            to name their LGBTQ+ celebrity icons, many interviewees (across all
            identities) suggested popstar <span class="bold">Lady Gaga</span>.
            <br /><br />
            In order to prototype the selfie filter feature, we looked into
            <span class="bold">Spark AR Studio</span> - a Facebook developed
            software used for creating AR effects for Facebook and Instagram.
            Hanna and I gave ourselves one weekend to learn how to use Spark AR
            - failing that we would have to borrow already existing selfie
            filters and move on. <br /><br />
            Without any prior animation experience, Hanna and I put our trust in
            YouTube, and after watching a few tutorials we gradually started to
            make progress with Spark AR. By the end of the weekend we had 5
            effects ready to go.

            For many LGBTQ+ people,
            <span class="bold">starting to explore</span> and express their
            identities is done carefully, either because they are still unsure,
            or because their social or family environment makes expression
            difficult. <br /><br />
            We imagined ways that users could
            <span class="bold">share experiences</span>, and
            <span class="bold">find solidarity</span>, in a safe environment. We
            thought that a feature allowing users to
            <span class="bold">share stories</span> anonymously would be a good
            way to do this, similar to
            <a class="desc_link" href="https://postsecret.com/">PostSecret</a>
            confessions. <br /><br />
            In order to find similar features developed for mobile (PostSecret
            is currenly only on desktop) , we researched other
            <span class="bold">anonymous social media</span> apps used
            Generation Z, including

            filters and sharing stories features in a seamless way.
            <br /><br />
            We developed the three card introduction to show upon app launch.

            minimum age of 12 years old, so users could feel free to express
            themselves privately.
            <br /><br />
            Like other anonymous social networks, there is an anonymous use ID,
            and no email address or phone number is required to sign-up. All
            user data is stored in the app.
            <br /><br />
            Unlike some other anonymous social networks, we decided against a
            private messaging feature (users may only publicy post comments).
            Keeping comments public would also help to regulate bullying.

            We wanted to find names for our two main features that would be
            memorable, and also be easy to understand for new users. Keeping
            with the "Booth" theme, one working version we had was:
            <ul>
              <li>Photo Booth</li>
              <li>Confession Booth</li>
            </ul>
            Initially we felt that "Confession Booth" was an easy way to
            describe a space to share secrets. However after user feedback, we
            realised it's possible offense to LGBTQ+ users of catholic religious
            background. Users also pointed out that, for some, going to church
            confession was done more of guilt than self expression.
            <br /><br />
            After further testing we decided on our final version:
            <ul>
              <li>Photo Booth</li>
              <li>Story Booth</li>

          <div class="desc">
            For the user flow of the Story Booth, we took inspiration from
            Facebook and instagram. Two widely used, well-known, and intuitive
            interfaces. We decided to use the "feed" as a start page, where
            users can scroll quickly through posts. Users can click to expand
            the and read more of a post. And each post has the option to be
            bookmarked or liked.
            <br /><br />
            In order to reach the camera with selfie filter options, users have
            to swipe left. As with Instagram, users have the option to scroll
            through selfie filters by swiping, and then save each photo to their
            phone if desired.
            <br /><br />
            In order to go back to the feed, users have to swipe back left.

            For the logo and header fonts we chose Gilbert, which was created in
            the memory of Gilbert Baker who was the creator of the rainbow flag.
            We used both the rainbow, and black versions. For the text
            description font, we chose Poppins regular in two sizes.
            <br /><br />
            According to stakeholder wishes, we kept hot pink as a prominent
            colour in the font, and as a highlight colour in the body of the
            app. After testing both light and dark versions, we went with a
            nearly background in order to make the rainbow colours of the logo,
            and of the confessions, stand out more.

            For the Story Feed posts, users may scroll through the latests posts
            or filter posts using a keyword search. The design choice for the
            user is simple in order to facilitate quick and easy posting - users
            may only choose the colour of the text, which is done by swiping.
