            <span class="bold">GOALGIRLS</span> is a Berlin creative agency,
            founded in 2017 by sisters Helena and Kaddie Rothe. Their focus is
            female driven and
            <span class="bold">culturally aware projects</span> with brands such
            as Bumble, Netflix, Casper, and ARMEDANGELS in their portfolio.
            <br /><br />
            The <span class="bold">Co-creagency</span> community was created in
            2019 - a talent pool of over 100 freelance
            <span class="bold">female creatives</span>, working in an agile
            structure to generate innovative ideas for purpose-driven
            advertising campaigns.

            The Co-creagency needed to showcase it's
            <span class="bold">biggest asset</span>: The
            <span class="bold">talent pool</span> of female creatives female
            creatives. Although the selection process was done with care, there
            was not yet a way for outsiders to view who the Co-creagency
            members, and what their skillsets, were. <br /><br />
            All requests for member information had to be handled by the
            community manager - a <span class="bold">manual process</span>.

            Design and create a <span class="bold">working template</span> for a
            members database, for up to 150 members. <br /><br />
            With a <span class="bold">online database</span>, the goal would be:
            <ul>
              <li>Provide visiblity for the individual Co-creagency members</li>
              <li>Showcase the members' skillsets</li>
              <li>Help to recruit new members</li>
            </ul>
            The database should be <span class="bold">searchable</span>, and
            have an <span class="bold">easily updatable</span> template. The
            Co-creagency were inspired by a yearbook, however were open to all
            suggestions for the layout and functionality of the database.

          <div class="desc">
            The aim of the survey was to gain information from the Co-creagency
            talent pool regarding:
            <ul>
              <li>How the member database could help them</li>
              <li>What information they would be willing to share</li>
              <li>Their involvement with the Co-creagency</li>
            </ul>
            The key takeaways from the survey were:
            <ul>
              <li>
                85% saw seeing other members' skillsets as beneficial to them
              </li>
              <li>
                The three features that members' thought were most important to
                include were: Name, Skills, and Photograph
              </li>
              <li>
                Less important features to include were Biography, Social Media,
                and Website URL
              </li>
            </ul>
            Suggestions for other features to include were: a fun fact, and
            vision/passions.

            In order to get a better idea of what the Co-creagency would like
            for the format, I conducted a competitive analysis. The similar
            niche agencies in Berlin I researched did not have a member
            database, so I had to look internationally for examples.

            Had there been the timeframe to find people who had not already used
            WhatsApp, it would have been interesting to compare the different
            experiences.
