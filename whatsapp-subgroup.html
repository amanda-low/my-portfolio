          <p class="desc">
            Group chats are
            <span class="bold">overloaded</span> with information. Group chats
            with large groups of people can have
            <span class="bold">multiple conversations</span>
            going on at a time, and searching through them for
            <span class="bold">relevant information</span> is frustrating. Users
            often <span class="bold">mute or ignore</span> large group chats,
            which can mean that they miss out on information.

            Design a hypothetical

            I researched and user-tested the
            <span class="bold">existing features</span> related to the group
            chat to find ways to add seamlessly to the flow.

          <div class="desc">
            Initial ideas to trigger the creation of a subgroup include:
            <ul>
              <li>Adding a subgroup button within the main chat</li>
              <li>Forwarding a message to a subgroup</li>
              <li>
                Have an AI function that suggests moving a new conversation
                topic to a subgroup
              </li>
            </ul>
            After user testing it became clear that forwarding, by
            <span class="bold">long-pressing</span>
            on a message, was the most intuitive option.

          <div class="desc_title">Subgroup Button</div>
          <br /><br />
          <div class="desc">
            As it was a new feature, I first considered placing the "Create
            Subgroup" button somewhere more prominent, with a new design.
            However realising that this feature should eventually become a
            normal part of the menu, I placed it underneath the already existing
            "My Status" button and created an icon in a similar style.

          <div class="desc_title">Visibility In Main Groupchat</div>
          <br /><br />
          <div class="desc">
            This was one of the trickiest features to find a solution. The
            subgroup chat had to be visible in the main chat, yet not interrupt
            the conversation nor take up too much space.
            <br /><br />
            In order to make it intuitive, I took inspiration from the WhatsApp
            and Facebook Messenger contacts lists, which uses the group profile
            picture as the placeholder. Further testing showed that most users
            instantly recognised the purpose of the
            <span class="bold">subgroup chat list</span>. Similar to Faceboook,
            the chat list would be scrollable from left to right, should
            multiple subgroups exist.

          <br /><br />
          <div class="desc">
            Initially, I wanted subgroup chats to show as another individual
            chat in the chats list, however users found this too messy during
            testing. Many users have multiple active chats, adding to the
            already long list became confusing. The solution I came up with was
            a stacked profile picture, showing that there is more than one
            conversation there, without taking up more space.

            As an app used by many on a daily basis, many people have strong
            likes and dislikes with using WhatsApp, which became apparent during
            user testing. <br /><br />
            Had there been the timeframe to find people who had not already used
            WhatsApp, it would have been interesting to compare the different
            experiences.

          <div class="desc">
            Even simple looking UIs pack in a lot of detail efficiently, and the
            art to adding a new feature is not to add to the clutter. Rather
            than adding a new button in order to create a subgroup, I used the
            already existing forward function. The only thing I added that took
            up space was "Create Subgroups" button, however I stuck to the
            already existing style and layout of the page.
