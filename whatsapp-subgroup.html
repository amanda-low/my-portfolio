        <span class="main_title bold">Problem</span> <br /><br />

        WhatsApp group chats are useful for broadcasting information, however,
        the larger the group gets, the more simultaneous conversations can
        become confusing. Designing a subgroup chat feature would help to sort
        conversation topics so that users are not frustrated by irrelevant
        information. <br /><br />

        I aimed to integrate the new feature seamlessly into the user flow, in
        line with the existing WhatsApp UI design. <br /><br />

        This was Project 4 (Add a Feature) of the Ironhack UX/UI Bootcamp. The
        ideas for the hypothetical new features were thought up by fellow
        students. I worked alone on the user research, analysis, prototyping,
        testing and UI design.

          <span class="bold">Experiences</span> <br /><br />

          First I interviewed some WhatsApp users on their experiences with
          group chats. Reasons that users used group chats included: keeping in
          touch with friends and family, working on university projects, keeping
          up with hobbies e.g. a dance class, organising vacations, and
          organising events e.g. a wine tasting event.</span

            to read everything in the chat." </span

      </div>
      <div class="desc">
        <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Pain Points</span> <br /><br />

        Regardless of the purpose of the group, all users had one pain point in
        common: Irrelevant information. Users receive mobile notifications for
        messages received, yet when they opened the group chat they often
        received information that was not relevant to them. As a result, they
        muted notifications or simply stopped reading the group chat.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="desc">
          <span class="bold">Desires</span> <br /><br />

          Besides creating a subgroup chat, other desires users had included:
          being able to highlight important information within the main group,
          making it easier to search chats, and the ability to connect group
          chat appointments to a Gmail calendar.</span

      <div>
        <span class="main_title bold">Subgroup Trigger </span> <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">User Flow</span> <br /><br />
        The next step was to define where in the user flow the trigger for the
        subgroup should be. The new feature should be integrated seamlessly into
        the existing user flow, and be easy to find - catering to the wide user
        demographic. Ideas I had after speaking to users were:
        <ol class="numbered_list">
          <li>Adding a subgroup button within the main group chat</li>
          <li>
            Using AI to suggest that certain messages should be moved to a group
            chat
          </li>
          <li>Forwarding messages from the main chat to a subgroup</li>
        </ol>
        I then tested these ideas with a lo-fi prototype and it became clear
        that the most intuitive for users was
        <span class="bold">option 3</span>. Users felt that forwarding a message
        was the easiest option to comprehend as it was already part of their
        user flow. <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Long-Press Gesture</span> <br /><br />
        Long-pressing on any chat message will bring up a menu, with options to
        star, reply, forward, copy, delete a message and more. A known feature
        in other messaging apps such as Facebook Messenger and Telegram, using
        this as a subgroup trigger would require the least barrier to entry for
        the user.

    <!-- Subgroup Visibility -->

    <div class="header_texts desc">
      <div>
        <span class="main_title bold">Subgroup Visibility </span> <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">User Flow</span> <br /><br />
        After selecting “Forward” from the menu, the next page is a list of
        suggested contacts to send the message to. Since the subgroup could only
        contain members from the main group, the “Create Subgroup” option had to
        be on this page. <br /><br />

        As my research showed that users would rather be completely excluded
        from certain conversations than have to receive notifications, I also
        included the option to choose who from the main group would be included
        in the subgroup. Users may choose “Select All” or select people
        individually. <br /><br />
        As it was a new feature, I first considered placing the "Create
        Subgroup" button somewhere more prominent, with a new design. However
        realising that this feature should eventually become a normal part of
        the menu, I situated it as an option to the already existing "My Status"
        button. Inspired by the “My Status” icon, and an old-school desktop
        folder icon, I created a hybrid
        <span class="bold">subgroup icon</span>.
      </div>
      <div class="">
        <img
          src="whatsapp subgroup icon.png"
          class="img_block img_border"
          alt=""
        />
        <br /><br />
        <figcaption class="img_desc">Subgroup Icon</figcaption>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header_texts desc">
      <div>
        <img
          src="whatsapp subgroup title, scrollbar.png"
          class="img_block"
          alt=""
        />
        <figcaption class="img_desc">Title Format & Subgroup Bar</figcaption>
      </div>
      <div>
        <span class="bold">Main Group Chat Visibility</span> <br /><br />
        Once the recipients are selected and a subgroup title is chosen, the
        messages are forwarded and the subgroup is created. The subgroup chat
        has the <span class="bold">title format</span>: “Main Chat Title”/
        "Subgroup Chat Title” - as a navigation guide for the users. User
        research indicated that users wanted the messaging experience of the
        subgroup to be identical to the main group, so rather than changing the
        font or background colour, only the page header appears changed.
        <br /><br />

        Once you navigate back to the main group, the existence of a subgroup
        should be visible, as users indicated that they wanted to be able to see
        which subgroup topics existed - should they want to be invited later. In
        order to make it intuitive, I took inspiration from the WhatsApp and
        Facebook Messenger contacts lists, which uses the group profile picture
        as the placeholder. <br /><br />

        The <span class="bold">subgroup “bar”</span> would be scrollable from
        left to right, should multiple subgroups exist, and would disappear on
        scrolling, to not interrupt the conversation.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="header_texts desc">
      <div>
        <span class="bold">Chat List Visibility</span> <br /><br />
        Once you navigate back to the main chat list, the existence of a
        subgroup should also be visible there. I prototyped adding this as
        another line entry in the chat list, however, users found this messy and
        confusing, as many already had a long list of personal and group chats.
        <br /><br />

        Inspired by a “Group Player” icon where user icons are stacked on top of
        each other, I stacked the group and subgroup profile pictures,
        indicating that a subgroup conversation exists without taking up
        additional space. <br /><br />
        <span class="main_title bold">UI </span> <br /><br />
        The brief for the Hi-fi prototype was a pixel-perfect clone of the
        WhatsApp UI, and manually recreating all icons. This required analysing
        the atomic design - breaking down the common colours, shapes, symbols,
        and formats. I soon realised that what I thought would be a simple
        clone, would take a bit more time to create. Mobile apps, and in
        particular messaging apps, pack in a lot of information and detail onto
        a small screen.

        As a frequently used, well-known app, many people have strong opinions
        on WhatsApp, which became apparent during user testing. Had there been
        the timeframe to find people who had not already used WhatsApp, it would
        have been interesting to compare the different experiences. <br /><br />
        Given more time on this project, I would have found a way to indicate in
        the chat list different notification symbols for both messages from the
        main group chat, and the subgroup chat. Perhaps this could have been
        indicated by a new message symbol of a different colour.
