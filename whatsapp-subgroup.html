        The Queer Booth app is planned to be relaunched, however, the Photo
        Booth design, technology, and categories are now outdated. A redesign
        will ensure a successful relaunch and help the app to remain
        competitive.<br /><br />
        Our task was to do a complete overhaul of Queer Booth, including
        creating a more modern look for the UI, updating the Photo Booth with
        Augmented Reality (AR) filters, and finding a way to better represent
        the increasingly diverse LGBTQ+ community.

          The new feature should be integrated so as to not interrupt the

          cater to the wide user demographic, and intuitive. <br /><br />
          I researched and user-tested the
          <span class="bold">existing features</span> related to the group chat
          to find ways to add seamlessly to the flow.

          To assess the usability of possible solutions, I user-tested with

          found intuitive, or not.

        <br /><br />
        <div class="desc">
          Initial ideas to trigger the creation of a subgroup include:
          <ul>
            <li>Adding a subgroup button within the main chat</li>
            <li>Forwarding a message to a subgroup</li>
            <li>
              Have an AI function that suggests moving a new conversation topic
              to a subgroup
            </li>
          </ul>
          After user testing it became clear that forwarding, by
          <span class="bold">long-pressing</span>
          on a message, was the most intuitive option.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div class="desc_title">Subgroup Button</div>
        <br /><br />
        <div class="desc">
          As it was a new feature, I first considered placing the "Create
          Subgroup" button somewhere more prominent, with a new design. However
          realising that this feature should eventually become a normal part of
          the menu, I placed it underneath the already existing "My Status"
          button and created an icon in a similar style.

        <div class="desc_title">Visibility In Main Groupchat</div>
        <br /><br />
        <div class="desc">
          This was one of the trickiest features to find a solution. The
          subgroup chat had to be visible in the main chat, yet not interrupt
          the conversation nor take up too much space.
          <br /><br />
          In order to make it intuitive, I took inspiration from the WhatsApp
          and Facebook Messenger contacts lists, which uses the group profile
          picture as the placeholder. Further testing showed that most users
          instantly recognised the purpose of the
          <span class="bold">subgroup chat list</span>. Similar to Faceboook,
          the chat list would be scrollable from left to right, should multiple
          subgroups exist.

        <div class="desc">
          Initially, I wanted subgroup chats to show as another individual chat
          in the chats list, however users found this too messy during testing.
          Many users have multiple active chats, adding to the already long list
          became confusing. The solution I came up with was a stacked profile
          picture, showing that there is more than one conversation there,
          without taking up more space.

          As an app used by many on a daily basis, many people have strong likes
          and dislikes with using WhatsApp, which became apparent during user
          testing. <br /><br />
          Had there been the timeframe to find people who had not already used
          WhatsApp, it would have been interesting to compare the different
          experiences.

        <div class="desc">
          Even simple looking UIs pack in a lot of detail efficiently, and the
          art to adding a new feature is not to add to the clutter. Rather than
          adding a new button in order to create a subgroup, I used the already
          existing forward function. The only thing I added that took up space
          was "Create Subgroups" button, however I stuck to the already existing
          style and layout of the page.
