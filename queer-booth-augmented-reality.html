        <span class="bold">2015 //</span><br /><br />
        The original Queer Booth app was launched in 2015 by Jo Webber. After
        becoming aware of the extent of homophobic bullying when working with a
        youth charity, Jo wanted to normalise queerness and make education fun.
        Photo booth style apps were popular at the time, and noticing a gap in
        the market for an LGBTQ+ version, she decided to develop Queer Booth, to
        promote inclusiveness for LGBTQ+ youth. <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">2020 //</span> <br /><br />
        After pausing development of the app in 2016 due to resources, Jo was
        inspired in 2020 to relaunch Queer Booth by the new wave of LGBTQ+ apps.
        Hanna and I chose to work on the Queer Booth redesign after Jo submitted
        it for the Ironhack UX/UI Bootcamp students' final project round.

        We aimed to create the new Queer Booth app as a place to share stories
        without judgement, with LGBTQ+ themed selfie filters, keeping with the
        Photo Booth element. So users could express their inner and outer
        selves.

        <span class="bold">TikTok //</span> <br /><br />
        While the old Queer Booth was positioned closely to Snapchat, with a
        focus more on playful content. However, the new Queer Booth would be
        positioned more closely to TikTok. As a Social Entertainment network,
        TikTok fuses user-generated entertainment with cultural issues.
        Additionally, young LGBTQ+ users feel safer on TikTok, as their parents
        are not using it.

          From our interviews, top requests for filters included:
          <span class="bold">Pride and celebrity themed</span> filters. Asked to
          name their LGBTQ+ celebrity icons, many interviewees suggested pop
          star <span class="bold">Lady Gaga</span>. <br /><br />
          To prototype the selfie filters, we looked into
          <span class="bold">Spark AR Studio</span> - a Facebook developed
          software used for creating AR effects. Hanna and I then spent a
          weekend teaching ourselves how to use Spark AR, resulting in five fun

          For many LGBTQ+ people,

          identities is done carefully, either because they are unsure, or their
          environment makes it difficult. <br /><br />
          We imagined ways that users could
          <span class="bold">share experiences</span>, and find
          <span class="bold">solidarity</span>, in a safe environment. We
          thought that a feature allowing users to

          While most users tested knew how the two features worked, we needed to
          make it clearer why we <span class="bold">combined</span> them
          together. <br /><br />
          After testing, it was clear that the concept of
          <span class="bold">inner and outer</span> self-expression had to be
          explained during the launch, resulting in the three card
          <span class="bold"> introduction</span> explaining the

          We wanted to find names for our two main features that would be

          <span class="bold">easy to understand</span>. Initially, we quite
          liked:

            <li>Photo Booth</li>
            <li>Confession Booth</li>
          </ul>
          However, after testing, users pointed out that, for some, going to
          church confession was done more out of religious guilt, than for self
          expression.
          <br /><br />
          After further brainstorming and testing, we decided to replace
          Confession Booth with <span class="bold">Story Booth</span>.

          sign-up would restrict users self-expression, so we instead
          implemented a self -regulating minimum age.<br /><br />
          There is an
          <span class="bold">anonymous user ID</span>, and no email address or
          phone number is required. All user data is stored in the app.
          <br /><br />
          However, we decided against a private messaging feature (users may
          only
          <span class="bold">publicly post comments</span>). Keeping comments
          public would also help to regulate bullying.

          As a last-minute addition, we added a Queer Booth
          <span class="bold">watermark</span> to selfies so that when shared on
          <span class="bold">external social media</span> it would bring more
          users to Queer Booth.

          For the posts displayed in the Story Booth feed, we took inspiration
          from our <span class="bold">user interviews</span> and from other
          anonymous social media. <br /><br />
          We wanted to demonstrate the
          <span class="bold">safe environment</span> created by Queer Booth v2,
          which allows users to express themselves freely, and to find
          representation.

          Jo was open to all of our ideas which meant a lot of
          <span class="bold">creative freedom.</span>
          However having fewer guidelines meant that we often had to find a
          balance between brainstorming wildly, and finding a
          <span class="bold">logical solution</span> to the problem.
          <br /><br />
          Our <span class="bold">user research</span> was therefore very
          important in our decision-making process, and we kept coming back to
          the data to give us direction whenever our brainstorming sessions got
          out of hand.

          The main takeaway from this project is the importance of thorough
          research. As LGBTQ+ self-expression exists on a wide spectrum,
          creating something meaningful as well as inclusive, required
          conducting research and data sorting with sensitivity. A solid
          research base was our guiding light in times of tough decisions and
          made the solution we developed all the more meaningful.
