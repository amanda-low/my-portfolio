        The Queer Booth app is planned to be relaunched, however, the Photo
        Booth design, technology, and categories are now outdated. A redesign
        will ensure a successful relaunch and help the app to remain
        competitive.<br /><br />
        Our task was to do a complete overhaul of Queer Booth, including
        creating a more modern look for the UI, updating the Photo Booth with
        Augmented Reality (AR) filters, and finding a way to better represent
        the diverse LGBTQ+ community.

        <span class="bold">2015 </span><br /><br />
        The original Queer Booth app was launched in 2015 by Jo Webber, a
        digital marketer, who after working with a youth charity knew the
        longlasting effects of homophobic bullying. After noticing a gap in the
        Photo Booth app market for an LGBTQ+ version, she decided to develop
        Queer Booth to destigmatise queerness and make education fun for LGBTQ+
        youth.
        <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">2020 </span><br /><br />
        After pausing development of Queer Booth in 2016 due to resources, Jo
        was inspired to relaunch it by the <a href="https://www.tekrevol.com/blogs/best-lgbt-dating-apps/" class="desc_link">new wave</a> of queer dating apps. Hanna
        and I chose to work on the redesign after Jo submitted it for the
        Ironhack UX/UI Bootcamp students' final project round.

        A fan of Snapchat AR selfie filters, Bitmojis, and Facebook, Jo
        was excited to see how new technology could shape the app. <br /><br />
      
        <span class="bold">More Inclusivity </span><br /><br />
        While the original photo booth outfits were based on what could now be viewed as
        stereotypes of gay and lesbian identities, Jo wanted the new version to
        be inclusive for all on the LGBTQ+ spectrum. <br><br>
        <span class="bold">Meaningful Solution </span><br /><br />
        Despite an increase of LGBTQ+ advocacy, the issue of bullying and lack of inclusivity for LGBTQ+ people was still a problem, and we needed to investigate how to address this in 2020.

        First, we collected data from the LGBTQ+ community about how they expressed their sexual orientation and gender identity online. In 4 days we collected 140 Survey responses and conducted 8 personal interviews. <br /><br />
        Participants’ attitudes varied depending on their background and stage of "coming out". Nonetheless, we wanted our solution to be inclusive of all the opinions heard.

      <div class="desc">
        <span class="bold">Competitors </span> <br /><br />
        We also investigated how other social platforms were addressing LGBTQ+
        users. While Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat and TikTok already had some
        LGBTQ+ themed AR selfie filters, they were an afterthought to their main
        product. Some platforms were guilty of chasing the "<a href="https://mediasmarts.ca/digital-media-literacy/media-issues/diversity-media/queer-representation/pink-dollar-marketing-queer-representation-advertising" class="desc_link" target="_blank">Pink Dollar</a>", few

        To analyse the user research we collated relevant insights and
        statements using an affinity diagram, with the major themes appearing
        being: visibility and representation. Many we spoke to believed these
        two things were the key for self-acceptance, however not all agreed on
        the best form of self-expression. <br /><br />
        Users who were already “out” online indicated that they would use an
        LGBTQ+ Photo Booth feature, although expressing their sexual identity
        was something they were already doing. Some less confident users did not
        feel comfortable expressing their sexual identity online, however,
        gained assurance from seeing others sharing their stories/experiences.

        While most thought that LGBTQ+ Photo Booth selfies were a fun idea, they
        said that personal stories were a more meaningful way of finding
        representation. <br /><br />

        Based on this analysis we aimed to create the new Queer Booth app as a
        place to share stories without judgement, with LGBTQ+ themed selfie
        filters, keeping with the Photo Booth element. So users could express
        their inner and outer selves.

        Looking at the market, the original Queer Booth was positioned more
        closely to Snapchat, with its focus on more playful content. However,
        the new Queer Booth would be positioned more closely to TikTok. As a
        Social Entertainment network, TikTok fuses user-generated entertainment
        with cultural issues. Additionally, young LGBTQ+ users feel safer on
        TikTok, as their parents are <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/tiktok-coming-out-gay-trans-lgbtq" class="desc_link" target="_blank">not using</a> it.

          Using the MoSCoW Method to prioritise the features and functionalities

          else besides the two main features: Photo Booth and Story Booth.
          Combining these two features in one app, while unconventional, was
          important to address our problem statement. During our weekly call
          with our stakeholder Jo, we also received confirmation that she was
          behind our plan to add the Story Booth feature to Queer Booth.

        <span class="bold">Features </span><br /><br />
        As confirmed from Lo-fi and Mid-fi testing, users found the sharing stories feature beneficial for LGBTQ+ representation and also something that would keep them coming back to use the app. Therefore we made it as equally important as the photo booth, the original feature. <br><br>
        
          <span class="bold">Introduction</span><br /><br />
          To avoid confusion on the app concept, we added the three-card introduction on app launch explaining the Photo Booth, Story Booth, and anonymous environment. The same icons from the navigation menu are also used in the introduction.        <br><br>
        <span class="bold">Navigation Menu</span><br /><br />
          For users who might not find the swiping navigation intuitive, we included a navigation menu visible in the Story Booth feed.  Instead of navigation titles, we used <a href="https://thenounproject.com/eucalyp/collection/detective-glyph/" class="desc_link" target="_blank">Detective-Glyph</a> icons as users found that icons helped them to faster comprehend the app concept. <br><br>
          <span class="bold">Story Posting</span><br /><br />
          To simplify the process of posting a story we limited the user’s design choice, and post length. Users may only choose font colour (by tapping) and must only post a story of 140 characters, with an optional back story. <br><br>    
          <span class="bold">Browsing Filters</span><br /><br />
          To make it faster for users to browse the AR selfie filters, we removed categories, and taking inspiration from Instagram added a scrollable camera button.

        To prototype the selfie filters, we used <a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/" class="desc_link" target="_blank
      ">Spark AR Studio</a> - a Facebook developed software used for creating AR effects. Hanna and I spent a weekend teaching ourselves the software so that we could create in real life the effects we had in mind. Our AR selfie filters include Pride themes, LGBTQ+ themed TV shows, and LGBTQ+ icons (Lady Gaga was the most requested celebrity icon from our user research).

      <div>
        <span class="bold">Real-Life Touches </span><br /><br />
        For the posts displayed in the Story Booth feed, we took inspiration from our user interviews and real-life posts from Anonymous Social Media platforms. Hanna was our model for the final prototype and her joyful reaction in the video is real - "Shane" is her favourite character from the show <a href="https://www.sho.com/the-l-word" class="desc_link" target="_blank">The L Word</a>.

As a last-minute addition, we added a Queer Booth watermark to selfies so that when shared on external social media it would bring more users to Queer Booth.

        Jo was open to all of our ideas which gave us a lot of creative freedom. However having fewer guidelines meant that we often had to find a balance between brainstorming wildly, and finding a logical solution to the problem. <br><br>

        Our user research was, therefore, an integral part of our decision-making process that we kept coming back to in times of doubt. Thoughtful research and analysis was our backbone of design with which, I believe, we created an inclusive and meaningful solution. <br><br>
        <div class="main_title">Project Status [ April 2020 ]</div><br>
        Development of the app is paused as Jo, our stakeholder, will relocate to Berlin from London. She is enthusiastic about the redesign of her passion project, and plans to continue working on obtaining funding for the relaunch.
