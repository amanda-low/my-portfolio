          <p class="desc">
            The original Queer Booth app was
            <span class="bold">launched in 2015</span> by Jo Webber. At the
            time, photo booth style apps were popular and she noticed a
            <span class="bold">gap in the market</span> for a version that
            catered to the LGBTQ+ community.
          </p>
          <p class="desc">
            Also, aware of the extent of homophobic bullying after working with a
            youth charity, Jo wanted to
            <span class="bold">normalise queerness</span> and make education
            fun. In 2016 she <span>paused further development</span> of
            the app due to lack of resources.

            of LGBTQ+ apps, Jo wanted to
            <span class="bold">relaunch</span> Queer Booth - her passion
            project.
            However the app needed to be updated to fit current technology - with
          augmented
            reality (AR)
            <span class="bold">selfie filters</span> now all the rage. <br /><br />
            While the original app had showcased outfits on what could
            now be viewed as stereotypes of gay and lesbian identities, Jo
            wanted the new version to be inclusive for all on the
            <span class="bold">LGBTQ+ spectrum.</span>

           Hanna and I chose to work on the Queer Booth redesign after Jo submitted it for the Ironhack UX/UI Bootcamp students' final project round. 
          <br /><br />
            Inspired by Bitmojis, Facebook Stickers, queer dating apps, and
            SnapChat selfie filters, she was excited to see how the
            <span class="bold">new technology</span> could
           be utilised.<br /><br />

            Jo was open to a complete
            <span class="bold">design overhall</span> - however she wanted the hot pink of the original logo to
            remain. It was also important to her that the
            user experience was
            seamless, and the target
            audience remain <span class="bold">Generation Z</span>.

            Our research aim was to collect

            community regarding self expression of sexual orientation and gender identity.

            In over 3 days we received over 140 responses, and the main trends were:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">65%</span> of Generation Z participants

            Nonethless we wanted our solution to be inclusive of all the
            opinions heard. <br /><br />
            After an intense card sorting session, Hanna and I narrowed down two
            major areas of concern:
            <ol>
              <li>Self Expression</li>
              <li>Representation</li>
            </ol>
            Social media plays a large role in LGBTQ+
            <span class="bold">representation</span>,
            and the people that needed the most
            <span class="bold">visiblity</span> were the ones just
            starting on their "journey".

            Our aim was to create the new Queer Booth app as a place to share
            stories without judgement, with LGBTQ+ themed selfie filters. So
            users can express their

          <div class="desc">
            From our interviews, top requests for filters included:
            <span class="bold">Pride and celebrity themed</span> filters. Asked
            to name their LGBTQ+ celebrity icons, many interviewees suggested popstar <span class="bold">Lady Gaga</span>.
            <br /><br />
           To prototype the selfie filters, we looked into
            <span class="bold">Spark AR Studio</span> - a Facebook developed
            software used for creating AR effects.
            
            Hanna and I then spent a weekend teaching ourselves how to use Spark AR, resulting in five fun effects.

            For many LGBTQ+ people,
            <span class="bold">starting to explore</span> and express their
            identities is done carefully, either because they are unsure or their
            environment makes it
            difficult. <br /><br />
            We imagined ways that users could
            <span class="bold">share experiences</span>, and find 
            <span class="bold">solidarity</span>, in a safe environment. We
            thought that a feature allowing users to
            <span class="bold">share stories</span> anonymously would assist this, similar to

            While most users tested knew how the two features worked, we needed to make it clearer why
            we <span class="bold">combined</span> them together. <br /><br />
            After testing, it was clear that the concept of
            <span class="bold">inner and outer</span> self expression had to be
            explained during the launch, resulting in the three card
            <span class="bold"> introduction</span> explaining the

            <ul>
              <li>Photo Booth</li>
              <li>Confession Booth</li>
            </ul>
            However after testing, users pointed out that, for some, going to church confession was done more
            out of religious guilt, than for self expression.
            <br /><br />
            After further brainstorming and testing we decided to replace Confession Booth with <span class="bold">Story Booth</span>.

            parental consent in order to sign-up would restrict users self expression, so we instead implemented a self
            regulating minimum age.<br /><br />
            There is an
            <span class="bold">anonymous user ID</span>, and no email address or
            phone number is required. All user data is stored in the
            app. <br /><br />
            However, we decided
            against a private messaging feature (users may only
            <span class="bold">publicy post comments</span>). Keeping comments
            public would also help to regulate bullying.

            To go back to the Story Booth, users have to
            <span class="bold">swipe right</span>, and then to access the User
            Account users swipe right again.

            Once we had the hi-fi prototype screens done we then had to prototype our Spark AR selfie filters.
         Hanna was our model for the prototype and her
            <span class="bold">joyful reaction</span> in the video is real - "Shane" is herfavourite character from the
            show "The L-Word". <br /><br />
            As a last minute addition we added a Queer Booth
            <span class="bold">watermark</span> to selfies so that when shared on
            <span class="bold">external social media</span> it would bring more users to Queer Booth.

            For the posts diplayed in the Story Booth feed, we took inspiration

            We wanted to demonstrate the
            <span class="bold">safe environment</span> created by Queer Booth
            v2, which allows users to express themselves freely, and to find
            representation.

             However having fewer guidelines meant that we often
            had to find a balance between brainstorming wildly, and finding a
            <span class="bold">logical solution</span> to the problem.
            <br /><br />
            Our <span class="bold">user research</span> was therefore very
            important in our decision making process, and we kept coming back to
            the data to give us direction whenever our brainstorming sessions
            got out of hand.

            The main takeaway from this project is the important of
            thorough research. As LGBTQ+ self expression exists on a wide spectrum, creating something meaningful as well as inclusive, required conducting research and data sorting with sensitivity. A solid research base was our guiding light in times of tough decisions, and made the solution we developed all the more meaningful.
