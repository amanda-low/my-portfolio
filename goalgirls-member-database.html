            is a Berlin creative agency, founded in 2017 by Helena and Kaddie
            Rothe. Their focus is <span class="bold">female</span> driven and
            <span class="bold">culturally aware projects</span> with brands such
            as Bumble, Netflix, Casper, and ARMEDANGELS in their portfolio.
            <br /><br />
            In 2019 they launched the
            <span class="bold">CO-CREAGENCY</span> community - a talent pool of
            over 100 freelance <span class="bold">female creatives</span>,
            working in an agile structure to generate innovative ideas for
            purpose-driven advertising campaigns.

            The CO-CREAGENCY needed to showcase it's
            <span class="bold">biggest asset</span>: The
            <span class="bold">talent pool</span> of female creatives female
            creatives. Although the selection process was done with care, there
            was not yet a way for outsiders to view who the CO-CREAGENCY
            members, and what their skillsets, were. <br /><br />
            All requests for member information had to be handled by the
            community manager - a <span class="bold">manual process</span>.

          <div class="desc">
            Design and create a <span class="bold">working template</span> for a
            members database, for up to 150 members. <br /><br />
            With a <span class="bold">online database</span>, the goal would be:
            <ul>
              <li>Provide visiblity for the individual CO-CREAGENCY members</li>
              <li>Showcase the members' skillsets</li>
              <li>Help to recruit new members</li>
            </ul>
            The database should be <span class="bold">searchable</span>, and
            have an <span class="bold">easily updatable</span> template. The
            CO-CREAGENCY were inspired by a yearbook, however were open to all
            suggestions for the layout and functionality of the database.
            <br /><br />
            As the website used the Wix CMS the database would have to fit
            within the parameters of what was possible there.

          <div class="desc">
            The aim of the survey was to gain information from the CO-CREAGENCY
            talent pool regarding:
            <ul>
              <li>How the member database could help them</li>
              <li>What information they would be willing to share</li>
              <li>Their involvement with the CO-CREAGENCY</li>
            </ul>
            The key takeaways from the survey were:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">85%</span> saw seeing other members'
                skillsets as beneficial to them
              </li>
              <li>
                The <span class="bold">top three features</span> that members'
                thought were most important were: Name, Skills, and Photograph
              </li>
              <li>
                <span class="bold">Less important</span> features to include
                were Biography, Social Media, and Website URL
              </li>
            </ul>
            Suggestions for other features to include were: a
            <span class="bold">fun fact</span>, and
            <span class="bold">vision</span>. <br /><br />
            After discussing the survey results with the CO-CREAGENCY, it was
            decide to emphasise the members' skillsets, by adding a filter to
            narrow down the members shown by selecting a certain skill.

          <div class="desc">
            In order to get a better idea of what the CO-CREAGENCY would like
            for the format, I created a competitive analysis for them. Similar
            niche agencies in Berlin I researched did not have a member
            database, so I had to look internationally for examples.
            <br /><br />
            While I researched both
            traditional and creative competitor layout styles, the final layout would be suject to the limitations of the Wix tool.
            <br /><br />
            Stakeholder feedback on the comptitive analysis included that the name should
            be below the photo, and no text should cover the photo. Preferred
            layout was 3 member cards per row.

          <div class="desc">
            In order to create an updatable template, I wanted to create a
            spreadsheet where member data could be entered, exported as a CSV
            file, then imported into the Wix Database. After testing with
            placeholders I found that text based fields were easily imported via
            spreadsheet into Wix, however to import images via spreadsheet, they
            needed to be hosted externally. As the website images wouuld be
            hosted on Wix, the photos would need to be uploaded and assigned
            manually.
            <br /><br />
            In order to create the "filter by skill" functionality, I employed Wix Corvid - an open development platform for adding JavaScript
            functionality to websites.

            Colour palette and fonts were already set by the CO-CREAGENCY brand
            guide. I kept the design simple, as the main task was to first test the functionality of the database. Plus, final adjustments to the design were still TBC by the CO-CREAGENCY creative director.
