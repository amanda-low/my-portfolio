        The GOALGIRLS creative agency has a talent pool of over 150 female creatives, however, there is no searchable list of member profiles. Creating a database will showcase the agency members’ skillsets, help to recruit new members, and reduce manual work. <br><br>

I aimed to create a searchable database, with an updatable template for new recruits to the agency. <br><br>

As a member of the GOALGIRLS creative agency, I received the brief from the community manager Tina and Creative Director Lea. I worked independently on the user research, analysis, prototyping, testing and UI design. <br><br>

        GOALGIRLS is a Berlin creative agency, founded in 2017 by Helena and Kaddie Rothe. Their focus is female-driven and culturally aware projects with brands such as Bumble, Netflix, Casper, and ARMEDANGELS in their portfolio. <br><br>

In 2019 they launched the CO-CREAGENCY community - a talent pool of over 150 freelance female creatives, working in an agile structure to generate innovative ideas for purpose-driven advertising campaigns.

        <span class="main_title bold">Research</span> <br /><br />
        <span class="bold">Stakeholder</span> <br><br>
        First I spoke to community manager Tina about her current process of managing members. In the early days of the agency, she was able to manage this using a spreadsheet and email lists. However, after subsequent recruitment drives, this became more difficult to manage, especially with previous members now inactive. Another issue was categorizing member’s skillsets. She had a record of the skillsets of members who had worked on projects for the agency, however, there was no record if these members had side projects, or from members yet to receive work. <br><br>
        <span class="bold">Competitive Analysis</span> <br><br>
        The agency was open to ideas regarding the format of each profile so to get a better idea of the market I created a competitive analysis for them, from similar-sized creative agencies. 

While I researched both traditional and creative competitor layout styles, I kept in mind that the final layout would be subject to the limitations of the Wix tool.

Stakeholder feedback on the competitive analysis included that the name should be below the photo, and no text should cover the photo.

        Next, I gathered data from the agency talent pool themselves using an online survey. The survey aimed to gain information regarding:
<ul>
  <li>How the member database could help them</li>
  <li>What information they would be willing to share</li>
  <li>Their involvement with the CO-CREAGENCY</li>
</ul>

     <div class="desc">
      <span class="main_title bold">Database</span> <br /><br />
      <span class="bold">Information Architecture</span> <br><br>

      To design the skill filter for the database, I needed an overview of all member skillsets. After communication with Tina and browsing the agency Slack channel I came up nearly 40 skills. This list had to be refined to find a balance between which filter values would make sense to database users, and also properly represent each member. <br><br>
      
      Some skills were too specific e.g. “content production”, “content management”, and content strategy”, and needed to put under an umbrella of a more common value e.g. “content creation”. Using information architecture to structure and refine the entries, and after further discussion with Tina,  resulted in a more manageable list of 25 skills. Members would be able to select 1-5 of these skills to be displayed in their member profile.     
      <br><br>

     <div class="desc">
      <span class="bold">Database Template</span> <br><br>

      In order to update the dataset of content in Wix, I created a Google spreadsheet template. Once new member data is entered, it can be exported as a CSV file and then imported into Wix. <br><br>
      
      Once I had created the spreadsheet format, I created a handover manual for Tina and walked her through the instructions on how to update the database. <br><br>
      <span class="bold">Skill Filter</span><br><br>

      As the database needed a consistent design for each profile, even after adding new members, I used the Wix repeater function -  an element that displays multiple items using the same layout.
      
      I linked the repeater to a dataset of content, to dynamically display the content on the page in pre-determined containers. <br><br>
      
      To create the "filter by skill" functionality, I employed Wix Corvid - an open development platform for adding JavaScript functionality to Wix websites. <br><br>

      <span class="main_title bold">Takeaways</span> <br /><br />

      Designing a database that was functional, was able to be infinitely updated, and also fitted to brand guidelines, was an enjoyable challenge. Using the Wix repeater function meant there were limitations on what I could do with the page layout, however it was reassuring that if new members were added in the future, the individual profiles would still have my original design. <br><br>

Due to the COVID pandemic lockdown in Berlin, this project was done completely remotely. However weekly calls and communication on Slack with Tina and Lea ensured that I received timely feedback. Plus, one advantage of the lockdown was they had less pressure from other clients and could focus on the database, which had long been on the backburner.

      <br><br>
       <span class="main_title bold">Project Status [ September 2020 ]</span> <br /><br />
      
      Due to agency business returning to normal after the COVID lockdown, plus the summer break, implementation of the database had been paused. However, my design for the database has received approval from the founders and a go-live is planned after the next wave of member recruitment.
